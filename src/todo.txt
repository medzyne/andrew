in step 3.  Template. There are 4 function

First- Choose Layout ( 3 layout as I send you in previous email)
Second- color picker for Background color
Third - color picker for icon color (color of the text and border)
Forth- upload photo for background


webpack --optimize-minimize


These are the things I think I need to get done:

1. better css and design for the app
2. a layout for the view when you click on an app
5. figuring out a solution to the initial shop_detail or initial shop_id problem:
6. only sending data to server if the inputs in a section were changed
7. uploading the iphone background image and previewing it
8. cache the images
9. dropzone no cancel on server error

Here is the design attached with this email, I think it might help you to create CSS
However, the color that you have to use are #4fa5b8 and #beded6
