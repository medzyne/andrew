in step 3.  Template. There are 4 function

First- Choose Layout ( 3 layout as I send you in previous email)
Second- color picker for Background color
Third - color picker for icon color (color of the text and border)
Forth- upload photo for background


webpack --optimize-minimize


These are the things I think I need to get done:

2. a layout for the view when you click on an app
6. only sending data to server if the inputs in a section were changed
8. cache the images
9. dropzone no cancel on server error
10. this.update_model


Front End:
1 the iPad app view needs style
2 mouse over highlights need better colors
3 templates section needs a more uniform design
4 the iPhone app name needs a gradient background
5 the app buttons need to get rid of text
6 don't show send

Back End
1 don't resend data unless the data has been altered
2 get more of the app to load from server
3 lock all features until shop id has been set
4 if shop id hasn't been set return an error
5 add validation to inputs

Here is the design attached with this email, I think it might help you to create CSS
However, the color that you have to use are #4fa5b8 and #beded6  #X1f603
