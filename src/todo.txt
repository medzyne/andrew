webpack --optimize-minimize


These are the things I think I need to get done:

2. a layout for the view when you click on an app
8. cache the images
9. dropzone no cancel on server error


Front End:
1 the iPhone app view needs style
4 add filters to photos use svg

Back End
3 lock all features until shop id has been set
5 add validation to inputs

Here is the design attached with this email, I think it might help you to create CSS
However, the color that you have to use are #4fa5b8 and #beded6  #X1f603
