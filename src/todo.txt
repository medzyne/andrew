in step 3.  Template. There are 4 function

First- Choose Layout ( 3 layout as I send you in previous email)
Second- color picker for Background color
Third - color picker for icon color (color of the text and border)
Forth- upload photo for background


webpack --optimize-minimize


These are the things I think I need to get done:

1. better css and design for the app
2. a layout for the view when you click on an app
6. only sending data to server if the inputs in a section were changed
7. uploading the iphone background image and previewing it
8. cache the images
9. dropzone no cancel on server error
10. this.update_model

Here is the design attached with this email, I think it might help you to create CSS
However, the color that you have to use are #4fa5b8 and #beded6


the border of each features on step 2,
can you make its corner a bit rounder?
and just adjust the space of each box properly

and the navigation: (1. Name Your Shop 2. Features 3. Templates)
 can you add more CSS based on the mock up fileÂ Â I send you?
 I think it would look nicer ðŸ˜ƒ
oh and the colour,we didnâ€™t use the blue and green anymore,
I believe I send you the HEX code via email
(the email that mock up files are attached I think)
