webpack --optimize-minimize


These are the things I think I need to get done:
1. ADD FACEBOOK FAN PAGE IMPORT
8. cache the images
9. dropzone no cancel on server error
10. make iphone apps scrollable



Front End:
1 the iPhone app view needs style

Back End
3 lock all features until shop id has been set
5 add validation to inputs

Here is the design attached with this email, I think it might help you to create CSS
However, the color that you have to use are #4fa5b8 and #beded6  #X1f603

1. Call us box look great!, but can you make it background still at the first page?
2. Call number don’t update to the database (table name shop_call)
3. gallery- it keep saying 'Please Update Shop Name at first tab’
(even I check the database that the shop name already created)
4. Template- selected color code not updated to the database
(table name shop_style) and also the template pattern (one, two, three)
5. Template- the Background color and Theme color make me confusing.
Seem like you apply  the filter over all the whole button right?
I mean the color I selected and the color show on the iPhone is not match (because the overlap filter?)
